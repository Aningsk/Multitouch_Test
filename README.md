#Multitouch Test (Version 1.1.2) 
This project is forked by Aningsk from <a href='https://github.com/LeonardoCardoso' target='_blank'>@LeonardoCardoso</a>. 
Thanks Leocardz very much~!
I will change it for my requirements, and comply with Apache License Version 2.0

##Description
The project is used to test Android device multitouch function. 
I add a feature that make the APP can draw lines following fingers' movement.

I use ADT(eclipse) to develop this project. 
And run it on Android-4.2.2, Android-4.4.2 and Android-4.4.3 (I don't test it on other Android versions.)

* Android Developer Tools 
    Build:v22.6.2-1085508
    with supported by "**android-support-v7-appcompat**"

That is very very difficult to get ADT and some support library, since Google had been **GFWed**... 
I'm a Chinese newbie programmer without any VPN @\_@

##Version Mark 
* 1.1.2 (2016-01-07)
    Renovate the Class Line.
    Actually, I cannot feel any difference while the APP is running.
    But I wanna write more graceful code.
* 1.1.1 (2016-01-06)
    Adjust menu, and change default value.
    The datum saved for the APP will be fewer.
* 1.1 (2016-01-06)
    Now version-1.1 can draw line, and I test it successfully on real Android device.
    I add a Java Class named as "Line", and Multitouch.java had been changed.
* 1.0 (2016-01-04)
    I can build the project and run it in AVD.
    Until now, I don't try run it on a reality Android device.
    This APP could show the orignal functions developed by Leonardocardoso.
    And I revonated AndroidManifest.xml.

The orignal README.md as follows:
